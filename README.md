Overview
This repository contains code for performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews from the Diwali dataset sale. The Diwali dataset sale consists of customer reviews and ratings from a popular e-commerce platform during the Diwali season.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: The raw text data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information. This includes removing special characters, stopwords, and performing lemmatization or stemming.
Feature Extraction: Text features are extracted from the preprocessed data using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings such as Word2Vec or GloVe.
Model Training: Various machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or deep learning models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) are trained on the extracted features to classify the sentiment of the reviews.
Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure their performance in classifying sentiment.
